		<p class="contentText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While creating a liquid layout to answer this question I decided to create a web page to incapsulate all the questions. This site is a Liquid layout using HTML, CSS and Javascript as well as JQuery. Liquid layout sizes are set relative to the window size, not absolute in pixels. They are beneficial for different resolutions, as resolutions change the dimension change to match the percentages. This lets you used more screen real-estate if it is available. With so many form factors out there today ( tablet, laptop, desktop) you can potentially create one for all of them and have them scale appropriately. </p>
